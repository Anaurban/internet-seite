 <h2>Inner Beauty & Inspiration</h2>
 <div class="description-section" > 
 <div class="half-width">
   <p>
      True beauty begins the moment you stop comparing yourself to others.  
      It grows quietly, with every act of kindness, every moment of peace,  
      and every time you choose to believe in your own worth.  
      The glow you seek on the outside starts from within — it's the reflection  
      of your confidence, your calm, and the way you treat the world around you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Glow Within is a reminder that you don't need to shine like anyone else —  
      your light is already enough. Breathe, trust yourself, and let your calm  
      confidence be the most beautiful thing about you.  
      You are allowed to take your time, to rest, and to rise again stronger.  
      Every season of your life holds beauty, even the quiet ones.
    </p>

    <p>
      Take care of your mind, your body, and your heart. Speak gently to yourself.  
      Believe that you are deserving of softness and peace.  
      Because when you find harmony inside, you inspire others to do the same —  
      and that's how the world becomes a little brighter.
    </p>

      Peaceful Glow is a moment to pause, breathe, and reconnect with your calm.  
      It's about finding strength in stillness and light in simplicity.  
      Every quiet second you give yourself brings you closer to balance and harmony.
    </p>

    <p>
      You don't have to chase perfection — your serenity is your power.  
      Let your energy flow gently, and allow your inner light to radiate without effort.  
      This is what true beauty feels like — calm, confident, and completely yours.
